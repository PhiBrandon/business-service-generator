I have a product that I listed on Amazon a really long time ago, and I am having trouble updating my listing with the new images and description because Amazon is telling me the product already exists. However, I am not sure I set it up correctly the first time, and I want to do it right this time. I want to start with fulfilling myself, but I may end up doing FBA. I would like to make sure that I will be able to edit things myself if needed in the future. You could do a call and walk me thru listing, or you could do it for me and explain how I can edit things after if I need to, either way. I am only listing one product .
